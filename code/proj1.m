% Before trying to construct hybrid images, it is suggested that you
% implement my_imfilter.m and then debug it using proj1_test_filtering.m

% Debugging tip: You can split your MATLAB code into cells using "%%"
% comments. The cell containing the cursor has a light yellow background,
% and you can press Ctrl+Enter to run just the code in that cell. This is
% useful when projects get more complex and slow to rerun from scratch

close all; % closes all figures

%% Setup
% read images and convert to floating point format
image1 = im2single(imread('../data/dog.bmp'));
image2 = im2single(imread('../data/cat.bmp'));

% Several additional test cases are provided for you, but feel free to make
% your own (you'll need to align the images in a photo editor such as
% Photoshop). The hybrid images will differ depending on which image you
% assign as image1 (which will provide the low frequencies) and which image
% you asign as image2 (which will provide the high frequencies)

%% Filtering and Hybrid Image construction
cutoff_frequency = 7; %This is the standard deviation, in pixels, of the 
% Gaussian blur that will remove the high frequencies from one image and 
% remove the low frequencies from another image (by subtracting a blurred
% version from the original version). You will want to tune this for every
% image pair to get the best results.
filter = fspecial('Gaussian', cutoff_frequency*4+1, cutoff_frequency);

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% YOUR CODE BELOW. Use my_imfilter create 'low_frequencies' and
% 'high_frequencies' and then combine them to create 'hybrid_image'
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Remove the high frequencies from image1 by blurring it. The amount of
% blur that works best will vary with different image pairs
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%low_frequencies=
blur_filter = [1 1 1; 1 1 1; 1 1 1];
blur_filter = blur_filter / sum(sum(blur_filter)); %making the filter sum to 1
%image1_blur
%blur_image1 = my_imfilter(image1, blur_filter);
%low_frequencies=my_imfilter(image1, blur_filter);

%large_blur_image = my_imfilter(image1, large_1d_blur_filter);
%low_frequencies = my_imfilter(large_blur_image, large_1d_blur_filter'); 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Remove the low frequencies from image2. The easiest way to do this is to
% subtract a blurred version of image2 from the original version of image2.
% This will give you an image centered at zero with negative values.
